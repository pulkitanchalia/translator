This is a small translation utility using Gen AI which takes JSON input and produces translated files based on source and target language provided. Let me know your feedback, I will tweak prompts if needed.

Currently there is restriction for 16k tokens. So may not work for larger files, as a workaround split into multiple files.
 
For example - English: 1 word ≈ 1.3 tokens. French: 1 word ≈ 2 tokens
